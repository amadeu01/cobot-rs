# Cobot-RS

ðŸ¤– Cobot-rs

A cute little robot powered by Rust ðŸ¦€âš¡

Cobot is a small DIY robot project built in Rust, designed to explore robotics, sensors, and fun interactions. With its friendly face and wiggly legs, Cobot makes tinkering with embedded systems both educational and adorable.

## About

An ESP32-based collaborative robot (cobot) project written in Rust for learning embedded systems programming.

This project controls a 4-legged robot equipped with distance sensors. The cobot can be controlled remotely through multiple connectivity options including WiFi, internet, and potentially Bluetooth.

This project serves as a learning platform for:
- Rust programming language
- Embedded systems development
- ESP32 microcontroller programming
